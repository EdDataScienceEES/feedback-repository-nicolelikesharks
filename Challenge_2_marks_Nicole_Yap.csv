"Challenge2_data_vis","s1761850/1","Yap","Nicole","nicolelikesharks",4,71,"You've done a very good job at producing a clear, eye-catching and informative graph that clearly depicts a topical and engaging topic. You selected a great colour pallet that aims to increase accessibility to the figure for those with colour blindness, and it is very easy to interpret from high to low. You also included your figure in a very well thought out markdown file which excellently highlighted your key messages and story. I also think your panel conveys an appropriate amount of material, neither too cluttered nor too sparse. There are some minor areas for improvement that I think could have taken your figure to the next level! I think you could have revisited the way CO2 is written in your title (co2) - there is a way to add subscripts or superscripts to text, and perhaps thought about your scale for emissions per capita (if you had converted to kg instead of tonnes, each values would have been between 0.3-1.2 which is easier for a reader to interpret than 0.0003-0.0012). Furthermore, although you had units in your titles, it would have been great to see them in your legend too. Perhaps also mention what the grey countries represent (I'm assuming no data but that should be explicitly shown). I would also have included a note at the bottom of the plot crediting the data source (as well as in your repo README) so those viewing the figure can also see the credit. Your saved pdf looks better than the png scaling wise which means the version of your map included in the markdown file doesn't look quite as clean as the pdf itself. Those minor points aside, you did an excellent job and your produced a professional and informative looking figure that I could easily see being used in a professional news setting.",87,"You employed a very creative approach to conveying your news story, both in your figure and throughout your wider project. You demonstrated confident and effective use of the ggplot2, gridextra and maps packages whilst producing your figure and employed a viridis colour palette to great effect. You also deviated from default themes which was great to see, adding your own style to the maps you created. Beyond the figure, you took on an extremely creative approach, devising your own news corporation to great effect. The 'Coding Club Broadcasting' theme was excellent and I loved the way it ran throughout all aspects of your repo, markdown and recorded news broadcast (this was really inventive and entertaining)! The bubble plot was also excellent, really well created, particularly making it interactive, that showed excellent creativity and coding aptitude. To go further, it would have been awesome if you had managed to combine the bubble plot with your main figure to create a single item, that would have taken your figure for submission to the broadcasting agency to that next level! Great job all round!",69,"Your repository is excellently structured, everything is logically located and simple to find. Your README is extremely professional (particularly with the CCB broadcasting agency logo) and is really thorough, providing links to and detailed descriptions of all the important aspects of your repo. The use of code chunks was particularly impressive to see. It was good to see your repo contained all the necessary files, although it would have been good to see a more personalised etiquette file specific to your teams needs. Your code follows a good etiquette although it would have been good to see some of your scripts better commented (some are well sectioned, but don't have many informative comments should someone want to recreate your script). It was fine to have your scripts for each figure as individual scripts although there was a bit or data visualisation repetition when combining the figures as a result. The individual scripts were largely reproducible although one script, co2_map_code, appeared to have some unnecessary code at the bottom (life.exp?) that didn't run. Most of your commit messages followed the same style, but a few didn't follow the 'Name does X' style which would have been an improvement. Well done for saving your intermediate figures, but it may also have been good to save your output data frames too. Although there was a rough workflow in the minutes files, and you used the projects tab excellently to allocate tasks, an explicit separate workflow detailing the project from start to end would have been good to see.",88,"For those participating in the task: I think there was an excellent use of GitHub projects, issues and pull requests to facilitate cooperation and project management throughout the task. Tasks were appropriately divided up between team members, with each taking on different aspects of the code, repo design and organisation. You all contributed effectively to the project ideas and presentation (markdown and video) and it was clear through your meeting notes (great that you recorded these) that you were all involved in the project design. You communicated effective questions, problems and feedback through the issues and kept on top of closing issues and merging pull requests once complete. You made excellent use of the projects tab to delegate tasks and keep on track with key activities. This was a clear team effort by the 'Coding Club Broadcasting' team, well done! Really good work on this task. You contributed some really code and commits and clearly interacted effectively with your team throughout the challenge, both in original project ideas, organising team meetings, recording the minutes from these meetings and throughout the duration of the task. Well done also for creating the broadcast video! For next time, make sure your commit messages follow the same etiquette as the team, typically 'Name does ...'",79,"Nicole_Yap"
