"Challenge4_bigdata","s1761850/1","Yap","Nicole","nicolelikesharks",4,68,"You exhibited excellent collaborative skills on this project and having solved a couple of code conflicts, worked well together to produce a well devised, structured and professional report. You clearly understood GEE and made simple edits (e.g. colour) where appropriate. You produced an efficient and effective R script to produce your plot and your overall report was great. It had good ecological grounding, was well contextualised with real-world evidence, addressed your aims and hypotheses throughout and concluded well, relating your findings to local land management. Some improvements could have been made however. There were a few typos and errors throughout the report that a fraction more time for checking would have noted, perhaps focus on the report slightly earlier next time. Also your map of Canada didn't show your PA. The biggest issue however was that your data vis didn't reflect your written results. Your results say there is loss throughout the PA, but your plot shows gain almost every year and virtually zero loss. I think this is caused by a mis-labelling/colouring of your points/lines, but it undermined your results sadly. Also you can't get less than zero forest gain (as that would be loss) so that line shouldn't subtend zero. That mistake aside however, this was an excellent report.",71,"This project incorporated some nice creative and stylistic approaches. Your aims and hypotheses were clear and your methods and code devised to tackle them were appropriate and efficient. Your report was very professionally laid out and utilised photos to good effect. Targeting your report at the Authentic Canada Natural Reserve Managers was also a nice touch and increased the project's professional feel. You also changed the colours of the GEE gain and loss layers appropriately, although make sure they match the broader-scale map of Canada (this could have been formatted better to show the location of your PA more easily) and your scatterplot which had red and green the opposite way round. You did however apply some of your own theme elements to the data vis to create a plot with a clean aesthetic. To improve further, think about further changes you could have made to your plot that would have improved the effective reporting of your results and consider additional messages you could have explored in the available data.  Great that you had a code of conduct.",77,"Your project exhibited excellent reproducibility. You pre-registered your study, clearly stating the aim, hypotheses, datasets and methods you intended to use. Ensure that you complete this before undertaking any data analysis work next time. Your script that wrangled your data and produced your scatterplot was entirely reproducible and well commented, although check some of your comments/object names as they say you are making a barplot not a scatterplot. Your workflow was in the Projects tab was excellent and delegated tasks appropriately; make sure to close all these tasks in future. You also recorded minutes of your discussions which is excellent at increasing reproducibility, it detailed your workflow and delegation nicely. Perhaps record more of your decision making process if possible next time. You can also have more informative figure captions - instead of ""Scatter plot showing forest cover change over time"" you can say what the actual change was, people can see it's a scatterplot. There is no need to say the type of graph in the first sentence of the caption.",84,"The group participation throughout the entire challenge was exemplary from your team. You worked together excellently to create a productive, friendly and seemingly enjoyable working environment that I think was conducive to the great overall project outcome. You were all vocal throughout and communicated effectively to help delegate roles efficiently. You split tasks appropriately as per the workflow and all contributed effectively to the final report, well done! You contributed really well to the code throughout, essential for the final report your team produced. You also responded immediately to tutor feedback which was great to see. On future projects, try and ensure you keep focussed on your own designated tasks. Whilst you did for the most part, occasionally you would become distracted and all try and help on one task which slowed your progress at times.","You were a very good team member, you worked on the report and the code and worked well with your team overall. To improve, you could reach out to your peers more to either ask for help or ask how they are doing.",75,"Nicole_Yap"
