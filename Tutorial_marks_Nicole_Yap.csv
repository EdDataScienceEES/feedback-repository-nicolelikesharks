"Tutorial","s1761850/1","Yap","Nicole","nicolelikesharks",71,"I think this was a very good topic choice, entirely appropriate for a Coding Club tutorial. I think you followed on very nicely from an existing Coding Club tutorial and did very well at linking in earlier tutorials (be that Intro. To R or the first spatial plotting one). The bubble map was a lovely addition and complements the existing tutorial very well. I also think it was pitched at an appropriate skill level, well done! My only criticism topic-wise would be is that it perhaps overlaps a little too much with the previous tutorial. Although it is necessary to show how to plot spatial data for this tutorial, you spend quite a lot of your tutorial on this when it is a skill developed in the previous one.",74,"I think this tutorial had an excellent structure. It clearly set out the background information, explained why the skill is important, what you can do with it and what you were going to learn. It then went through the relevant stages in a clear and logical order, all the way through to a logical and successful end point. You set out four clear stages and goals which you achieved. To improve, make sure you don't set out anything at the start that you won't achieve. You clearly stated you wouldn't complete all 5 of the SDM stages but you did say you would create maps visualising their 'future distributions' which didn't quite happen. Your instructions were also clear throughout however I think you could have used some more comments in your code, detailing more of the individual steps and lines.",72,"Your tutorial on the whole showed excellent reproducibility. All the required data was included, with additional resources appropriately linked to a separate public repo. Your code ran perfectly and the interactive map output was excellent. You also incorporated code chunks effectively into your tutorial. As always you engaged with the feedback very well, clearly stating your requirements and what you did/didn't include. There are some small things to work on. You had a couple of relic bits of text left in your tutorial here and there, your install.packages command was lacking parentheses, some of your images were laterally stretched cutting off the legend title. Also, I wouldn't round lat/long coords to integers as you need the detail included in spatial data for geospatial analyses. Those small points aside, excellent effort!",74,"I thought this tutorial was very creative. I thought the topic and bubble map creation was really creative and a nice skill to learn. Your tutorial was very professional throughout (bar the occasional stretched figure). Most of all, I thought the style with which it was written was exemplary. I loved the conversational, humorous tone, it was engaging and supportive for those taking the tutorial and I think it made for a very effective learning tool. The cartoons were also a nice touch! To improve, perhaps think about the presentation of your figures and maybe having a test yourself section at the end that the user can complete independently to test their newfound knowledge!",73,"Nicole_Yap"
