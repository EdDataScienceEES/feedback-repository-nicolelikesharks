You have provided very good explanations for why you chose your model syntax. You have demonstrated very good thought into the modelling.",78,"Your main figure is nice and clear, you could have chosen a different colour scheme that doesn't have both red and green for even nicer presentation.",76,"Overall your repository had an excellent readme file and great structure. Your script was fully reproducible and you have shown good coding practice with good comments throughout. There are a few broken links to your summary report, but I did manage to find it in the end! You have a hypothesis for an increase with excellent reasoning in your report but in your pre-registration you have both increase and decrease hypotheses and you haven't given reasons. Remember to include sample sizes in figure captions, as well as error around the stated slope.",68,"You could have participated in the issue with questions about the challenge and helped your peers/answered or asked questions.",75,"Nicole_Yap"
