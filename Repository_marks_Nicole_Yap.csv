"Repository","s1761850/1","Yap","Nicole","nicolelikesharks",66,"You have had decent engagement with Github over the course of the term, and have engaged well on the challenges in particular, although you have not included the challenges in your repository or evidence that you had incorporated feedback from the teaching team into those assignments.  You have done a decent job at engaging with issues throughout the year, and have provided some good feedback for your peers. Your commit messages are not very informative and you could add your name to them as well for consistency with the class repo (i.e. ‘Nicole added tutorial notes’ vs ‘Update readme’).",67,"Your repository is fairly easy to navigate, and you provide some navigation tips to help find your reading notes and coding club materials in your weekly challenges. Perhaps it would have been clearer to make folders broken down by theme instead of week.  Your commit messages are consistent but could be more informative and personalised and you have mostly done a good job at including all of your Coding Club tutorials and reading notes. ",67,"You have been somewhat consistent in adding your work and notes in your repository, although judging by the commit history most elements have been added close to the deadline instead of throughout. Some of the weekly folders are incomplete too, for example some are missing Coding Club materials, or only contain an RProj file.  ",67,"Your repo shows some creativity, for example including a navigation page with hyperlinks to your weekly folder. To go further, you could have added more detail about the course to your homepage readme document and more personal reflections or additional content from your personal study of the course materials.",67,"Nicole_Yap"
